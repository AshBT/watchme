We will have more examples and details, but for now, here are the example watcher
repos:

 - [watchme-system](https://github.com/vsoch/watchme-system) for system, sensors, users, and networking monitoring using psutils tasks.
 - [air-quality](https://github.com/vsoch/watchme-air-quality) for watching a metric across a few cities.

For either of the above, you can easily install and activate the watcher to run on
your machine! See [here](https://vsoch.github.io/watchme/getting-started/#how-do-i-get-a-watcher).
