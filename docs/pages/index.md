**WatchMe Python Client**

> What is WatchMe?

This is a simple tool to help you to reproducibly watch for changes in one or more
web pages. While there are some (limited functionality) online resources that
will help to track page changes, there are three problems.

 1. It's typically the case that you will be charged for more than a few pages
 2. It's not appropriate for a research setting where you would want programmatical parsing
 3. The configuration of your watcher is not reproducible.

Thus, you should use this tool if you don't want to pay for a service, want to
generate a reproducible watching, or just prefer command line tools.

> What is a watcher?

A watcher is a general helper to set regularly scheduled watching of things.
By default, the software will watch for changes to one or more urls, and
we will add other kinds of watchers (for example, system processes or similar)
as we think of them.

> Where do I go from here?

A good place to start is the [getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/) page.
Keep in mind this tool is *under development* and *not ready for use!*
