# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them.
Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - changed behaviour

## [master](https://github.com/vsoch/watchme/tree/master)
 - first beta release of watchme, all commands and docs (0.0.11)
 - adding changelog, and original skeleton for client  (0.0.1)
